                            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
    <p>An insect hotel, also known as a bug hotel or insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities â€“ particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects. Their purposes include hosting pollinators.</p>

Where to place your Insect Hotel. Solitary bees like to be warm so having the hotel on a south-facing wall is another consideration to aid their inhabitancy. Therefore, the best position for insect hotels is in sunlight or light shade, preferably 1.5m off the ground.</p>
