                            <h3>Dine @theZoo</h3>
    <p>Here at the Zoo we’re committed to doing our part and helping our visitors be stewards for the environment. Beverage items in vending machines throughout the Zoo are available in recyclable glass bottles and aluminum cans, reducing single-use plastic. It’s just a start, but soon we hope to move completely away from providing beverages in plastic bottles. Soda fountain drinks are available at our food locations.</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Open during the warmer months, experience the unique cuisine at the Zoo’s Pavilion Café located at the Bicentennial Pavilion. The new menu items will offer you many choices like a brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, smoke stack tacos, food truck fries, fried pickles and much more. Local craft beer, domestic beer and wine are also available. The Pavilion Café is open weekends from 11am-3pm.</p>
