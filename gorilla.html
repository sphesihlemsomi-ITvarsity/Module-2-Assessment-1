                            <h3>GEMBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.

      The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[3] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals. The name "gemsbok" in English is derived from Afrikaans gemsbok, which itself is derived from Dutch name of the male chamois, gemsbok,[4] and further from German Gämse ("chamois").[5] Although some superficial similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are noticed, the chamois and the oryx are not closely related. The usual pronunciation in English is /ˈɡɛmzbɒk/.  </p>

    <p>As one of 3 African species of the oryx genus, the gemsbok, or gemsbuck, can be found on the grasslands or savannas and on flat or hilly country in the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa. They are well adapted to the conditions of their hot, arid habitats.</p>
