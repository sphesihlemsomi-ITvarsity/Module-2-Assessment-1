               <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <P> Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal grouping within the family Elephantidae of the order Proboscidea.</P>
                <p>The trunk, or proboscis, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks, 12 deciduous premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives.</p>
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and The African bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs, deserts, marshes, and lake shores, they prefer to stay near water.</p>
                  <p><strong> Where will you find them?</strong></p>
                  <p>You will find the elephants at Pen E22 right next to the Amphitheatre</p>
